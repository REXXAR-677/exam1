      "I&#x27;m so puzzled by some of the comments here. Is it simply because of how the general public was inadequately educated about how vaccines work? Well, why are you only upset by this now? Because of how much your life has been affected? If not, why not be as vocal about other things that affect the general population <i>much more</i> in the grander scheme of things. e.g. the general public&#x27;s misunderstanding of simple statistics, or diet, or climate change etc.<p>I&#x27;ve been vaccinated (double-shot), after I got COVID 1 year ago. I&#x27;ve got Omicron afterwards - a mild cold, but noticeable. I&#x27;ve lost 3 family members to Covid19. My sister still hasn&#x27;t fully recovered her sense of smell&#x2F;taste after a year. The hospitals in my country were legitimately overrun for several months (I&#x27;m from South Africa). The infection rate was under-reported in some areas due to corruption but the excess deaths are undeniable.<p>Yes, COVID19 can kill. Yes, there can be some long lasting effects. Yes, some things are over and under-stated, and some governments have under&#x2F;over-reacted (to the point of being draconian). Yes, many people are asymptomatic and can carry on living as if they were never infected. Yes, some of these asymptomatic people can infect others who don&#x27;t have the same type of immune response. Yes, vaccines are effective against the variants they were designed for, and less effective against the mutated variants (how is this news?). Yes, even the less effective vaccines help against serious symptoms, death, and the overwhelming of health services. Yes, masks help against Covid and other airborne disease. Yes, washing hands help against bacteria and other some types of viral infection including COVID19.<p>What am I missing? What is it that people don&#x27;t understand about the situation? Why are people so upset about this, but not upset about things that are arguably more detrimental to the livelihood of the entire human race?",

      '&gt; Kessler syndrome is not going to happen because unlike their competitors SpaceX intentionally put all their satellites in very low orbit where the atmosphere naturally cleans up any debris within a couple of years.

I live in a country with a weak social safety net (United States).<p>If programming is &quot;a big part&quot; of your identity, get help for that. People work to make money. We are all in charge of our career choices, and we should pay attention to changes that might affect our work future. Having been in the programming business for four decades I've had to pay attention to the possibility that my job would get outsourced overseas -- that was a big thing a couple of decades ago, though it never happened to me because I made sure my skills weren't easily outsourced overseas or fobbed off on juniors with less experience.<p>Getting worried, feeling uncomfortable, having a &quot;visceral <em>reactio</em>n&quot; won't do any good. Nor will trying to push back against progress. What will do some good is paying attention to actual trends that affect your career, and figure out what you can safely ignore (like AI writing production code anytime soon). Everyone who doesn't want to end up out of a job has to continually adjust their skills and career path. None of us has a guaranteed &quot;place in the future,&quot; it's up to us to position ourselves for reasonably likely futures.",

      '&gt; Kessler syndrome is not going to happen because unlike their competitors SpaceX intentionally put all their satellites in very low orbit where the atmosphere naturally cleans up any debris within a couple of years. That&#x27;s something uniquely enabled by SpaceX&#x27;s low launch costs because it limits the useful life of the satellites, requiring frequent replacement.<p>I haven&#x27;t researched Starlink much before, but if the target satellite count is 10k (some say 30k?) and replacements are needed every 24 months, this suggests that to keep Starlink running they need to deploy an average of ~415 satellites every month, forever.  Some quick searching suggests a cost of $250k&#x2F;satellite[0], for a total monthly bill of over $100M.  I must be misunderstanding, because that seems pretty pricey, and it excludes launch costs, which they say are ~$30M.  Maybe everything will be cheaper by the time the constellation reaches 10k satellites.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.teslarati.com&#x2F;spacex-starlink-satellite-launch-second-announcement&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.teslarati.com&#x2F;spacex-starlink-satellite-launch-s...</a>',
